- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer_support_ai.git
   cd customer_support_ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your API keys
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
   ```

4. **Run the setup**
   ```bash
   python -c "from customer_support_agent.setup import run_full_setup; run_full_setup()"
   ```

5. **Launch the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## 🎮 Usage

### Streamlit Web Interface
The easiest way to interact with the system is through the Streamlit web interface:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

**🚀 First Time Setup:** When you first run the application, the database and vector store won't exist yet. Simply:

1. Click the **"📥 Download Database"** button to download the SQLite database
2. Click the **"🔄 Initialize Vector Store"** button to create the vector embeddings
3. Or click **"🚀 Complete Setup"** to perform both steps automatically
4. Once setup is complete, you can start chatting with the AI assistant

The setup buttons will only appear when needed and will be disabled once the respective components are properly initialized.

### Command Line Interface
For direct integration or testing:

```python
from customer_support_agent.main_graph import graph

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "passenger_id": "3442 587242",
        "thread_id": "conversation-1"
    }
}

response = graph.invoke(
    {"messages": [("user", "I need to change my flight")]},
    config
)
```

### Example Conversations

**Flight Modification:**
```
User: "I need to change my flight to next week"
AI: "I'll help you update your flight. Let me search for available options..."
```

**Hotel Booking:**
```
User: "I need a hotel in Paris for 3 nights"
AI: "I'll search for hotels in Paris. What's your preferred price range?"
```

**Multi-Service Planning:**
```
User: "Plan my entire trip to Rome - flight, hotel, and activities"
AI: "I'll help coordinate your complete Rome trip across all services..."
```

### Main Graph Flow Architecture

The system follows a sophisticated multi-workflow architecture where conversations flow through specialized assistants based on user intent and context:

#### **Core Flow Pattern:**
1. **Entry Point** (`start`) → **User Information Gathering** (`get_user_info`)
2. **Primary Assistant Hub** - Central coordinator for all conversations
3. **Workflow Routing** (`route_to_workflow`) - Intelligent delegation to specialized assistants
4. **Specialized Workflow Processing** - Domain-specific assistance with human-in-the-loop approval
5. **Return to Hub** - Seamless transition back to primary assistant for continued conversation

#### **Flight Workflow Details:**
The flight workflow exemplifies the detailed internal structure of each specialized assistant:

- **Entry Point** (`create_entry_point`) - Initializes flight-specific context
- **Flight Assistant** (`enter_update_flight`) - Specialized flight management agent
- **Tool Execution Layer:**
  - **Safe Tools** (`update_flight_safe_tools`) - Non-destructive operations (search, info lookup)
  - **Sensitive Tools** (`update_flight_sensitive_tools`) - Modification operations requiring approval
- **Skill Completion** (`leave_skill`) - Clean return to primary assistant with updated context
- **State Management** - Maintains conversation flow using `pop_dialog_state()` pattern

#### **Multi-Workflow Coordination:**
- **Car Rental Workflow** (`car_rental_subgraph`) - Vehicle booking and management
- **Hotel Workflow** (`hotel_subgraph`) - Accommodation search and reservations  
- **Excursion Workflow** (`excursion_subgraph`) - Activity recommendations and bookings

Each workflow follows the same pattern with entry points, specialized assistants, safe/sensitive tool separation, and controlled exit points, ensuring consistent user experience across all service domains.

#### **Human-in-the-Loop Integration:**
Critical operations (flight changes, bookings, cancellations) are routed through approval gates where users can review and approve/deny proposed actions before execution, maintaining safety and user control throughout the process.
